 **1.** **Classification explanation Ingredient:****
A component in a recipe that includes information about the name, amount, unit, calories, and food type. Step: A description-containing step in a recipe. Recipe: Displays a recipe and provides details such the name of the recipe, a list of the ingredients, a list of the steps, and the total number of calories. RecipeManager: This class has methods for adding, removing, and retrieving recipes. It manages a collection of recipes. UI: Manages the user interface and offers ways to communicate with the Recipe Manage

Explanation: This code enables a recipe management system to do operations like scaling and amount resetting, as well as add, remove, and display recipes. Additionally, it calculates the total calories in recipes and notifies the user if a recipe contains too many calories.

The recipes field in the RecipeManager class is a private list of recipes that contains all of the recipes that are currently in the Recipe Manager. A recipe is added to the list using the AddRecipe function. A recipe can be removed from the list using the RemoveRecipe method. A list of recipes is returned by the GetRecipeList method. The GetRecipeByName method uses the name of the recipe to search the list for it. The class for user interfaces (UI): The Run method displays a menu of options and starts the user interface loop by carrying out the option that was chosen. The AddRecipe function adds recipes to the Recipe Manager by allowing users to enter information about them, including name, ingredients, and steps. The RemoveRecipe method, as its name implies, enables the user to remove a recipe from the Recipe Manager. All of the recipe names are listed in the output of the DisplayRecipeList function. The user can select a recipe from the list and read its information, such as ingredients, steps, and total calories, by using the DisplayRecipeDetails function. Additionally, it determines whether the recipe has more than 300 calories and warns the user if it does. By inputting a new scale factor, the user can scale a recipe using the ScaleRecipe method, and the recipe is altered as a result. The user can go back to a recipe's original ingredient quantities by using the ResetRecipeQuantities method. Before cleaning the data, the ClearAllData method prompts the user to confirm that all recipes in the Recipe Manager have been deleted. There are also notifications when a recipe has more than 300 calories, which are handled by the RecipeNotification delegate, which is a new modification. The notificationDelegate is informed by the CheckRecipeCalorieLimit function if a recipe has more than 300 calories. An alert notice is shown when a recipe has more than 300 calories and the notificationDelegate is informed of it. The modified code has undergone the following modifications: To handle notifications when a recipe has more than 300 calories, a RecipeNotification delegate has been implemented. The Recipe class has been changed to enable both the computation of total calories and the inclusion of an infinite number of recipes. A name can now be entered by the user for each recipe. I implemented the AddRecipe, RemoveRecipe, DisplayRecipeList, DisplayRecipeDetails, ScaleRecipe, ResetRecipeQuantities, and ClearAllData methods to incorporate the required functionalities. I implemented the RecipeExceedsCalorieLimit function to control notifications when a recipe has more calories than 300. A check for the recipe's calorie restriction has been added to the AddRecipe function. The recipe list is now organized alphabetically by name thanks to a modification to the RecipeManager class.

***C. Brief description of what changed based on the feedback: ***

Based on my part1 feedback i made the following changes to improve my part2, I added the git hub repository to my part 2, i added the readme file to give more information and value to my code. I made sure that i minimised the errors and made sure that implemented an error handling because i did not have it in my first submission, this diplays when a user types an incorrect input, the code ask the user to re-enter the correct values before going to the next step. I also improved my layout by making sure that all the steps are listed clearly and allows the users to enter details without confusion, I also added a fuction that clears the user's input so they can proceed to a new recipe. In the previous task we used arrays but in this part i used the generic collections List method to store recipe information. I made sure the steps are well explained throughout the code to allow the user to use the app easily and get the desired outcome for their recipes
